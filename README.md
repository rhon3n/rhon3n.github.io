This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## App Structure

In the `/src` folder you will find 2 sub-folders, `/components` and `/helpers`.

### `/components`

In order to keep the project as clean as possible, I've decided to make each component its own module file with the same name. Components will always be named in PascalCase, all other files will be named in camelCase. `/components` also contains a special file called `componentIndex.js`. This file simply exports all modules in the `/components` folder. If a new file is added to the `/components` folder, that file must be manually added to `componentIndex.js`.

### `/helpers`

This folder contains modules that are helpful for keeping `App.js` clean. Currently, `fontawesome.js` is the only helper module. `fontawesome.js` imports all necessary fontawesome files and creates a custom library for our app to reference.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Does everything that `npm run build` does, but also pushes the current build to the rhon3n.github.io master branch and in turn, publishes the App.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
